The plan for this project is located in the file Plan.txt. Initially, no steps are completed.

As steps are completed (fully or partially), create/edit files called step1.txt, step2.txt, etc. and document what has been done so far and important decisions that were made in the process.

Before starting a task, review Plan.txt and all files named step*.txt in the main project directory to understand what has been done so far.
